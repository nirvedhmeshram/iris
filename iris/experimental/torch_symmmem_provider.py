"""PyTorch symmetric memory as an allocation provider for Iris device kernels.

Lets Iris device code operate on tensors from ``torch.distributed._symmetric_memory``
rather than from Iris's own symmetric heap. No Iris device code changes are
needed: iris.store, load and copy take ``heap_bases`` as a plain pointer argument
and translate with

    remote = peer_bases[to] + (ptr - peer_bases[local_rank])

so any table satisfying ``peer_bases[local_rank] == local allocation base``
drives them.

Torch hands that table over directly. Rendezvous returns a handle whose
``buffer_ptrs`` is a per-peer list of pointers into this process's address space,
with the local rank's entry equal to the tensor's own ``data_ptr()`` -- exactly
the invariant Iris needs. So this provider does no pointer arithmetic at all; it
reads the table off the handle per allocation.

That is worth preferring over the alternative even though the alternative also
works. Peer offsets happen to be constant across allocations, so one table could
be reused for all of them, but that only holds while every rank allocates in
lockstep: ``symm_mem.empty`` is a local call and only ``rendezvous`` is
collective, so ranks can diverge. Reading ``buffer_ptrs`` per allocation is
correct either way.

Scope is intra-node, set by the backend torch selects. The default backend
reports as ``'CUDA'`` and is the HIP IPC path on ROCm; it reaches peers sharing a
node. Do not call ``set_backend`` to try to change this -- the name
``get_backend`` returns is not one ``set_backend`` accepts, and forcing a
different backend selects one that fails at allocation.

``SymmetricAddressMap.direct`` records per-peer reachability for symmetry with
the other providers; a peer that is not directly addressable gets a base of 0,
which would translate to a wild pointer rather than an error, so callers are
expected to check it before launching.

This module is deliberately NOT imported by ``iris/experimental/__init__.py``.
Torch symmetric memory is a private torch API and its availability varies by
build, so importing it eagerly would make ``import iris`` fail on builds that
lack it.

The caller owns bootstrap and tensor lifetime; the process group must already be
initialised on a device backend:

    torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)
    dist.init_process_group("nccl")
    provider = TorchSymmMemProvider()
