"""rocSHMEM as an allocation provider for Iris device kernels.

Lets Iris device code operate on tensors allocated by rocSHMEM rather than from
Iris's own symmetric heap. No Iris device code changes are needed: iris.store,
load and copy take ``heap_bases`` as a plain pointer argument and translate with

    remote = peer_bases[to] + (ptr - peer_bases[local_rank])

so any table satisfying ``peer_bases[local_rank] == local allocation base``
drives them. This module builds that table for rocSHMEM memory.

The table comes from ``rocshmem_ptr(base, peer)``, OpenSHMEM's ``shmem_ptr``: an
address in this process's own address space for the peer's counterpart of a
symmetric object, or NULL when that peer is not reachable by direct load/store.

The per-peer offsets are queried once. rocSHMEM's peer mapping is a single
linear translation of the whole symmetric heap, so the offset from a local
address to its counterpart on a given peer is the same constant everywhere in
the heap. Only those offsets are cached; each allocation's table is materialised
from its own base, so ``peer_bases[local_rank]`` is always that allocation's
base. rocSHMEM's heap base, which it does not expose publicly, is never needed.

Because the offsets are shared, a table built for one allocation still
translates pointers belonging to another. iris.copy relies on that: it takes one
``heap_bases`` and translates two pointers against it.

Scope is intra-node. A peer not reachable by direct load/store gets a base of 0,
which would translate to a wild pointer rather than an error, so
``SymmetricAddressMap.direct`` records reachability per peer and callers are
expected to check it before launching. Inter-node peers need a transport this
module does not provide.

TODO: settle where this belongs. It sits in Iris on the assumption that Iris
hosts provider adapters; the alternative is for it to live alongside rocSHMEM,
which owns the allocation and the tensor lifetime. It is one file either way.

This module is deliberately NOT imported by ``iris/experimental/__init__.py``,
so ``import iris`` does not require rocshmem4py. Keep it that way: adding it to
that package's eager imports would make a rocSHMEM install mandatory for every
Iris user.

The dependency is ``rocshmem4py``, a standalone Python package from the
ROCm/rocm-systems repository rather than something a ROCm install provides. It
does not link rocSHMEM at run time; it statically links it into its extension
module, and its version records which rocSHMEM that was (e.g.
``0.1.0+rocshmem3.7.0``). So installing it needs no separate rocSHMEM on the
system, and the rocSHMEM build options it was compiled with -- ``USE_IPC`` in
particular -- are fixed at its build time, not selectable later.

The caller owns bootstrap and tensor lifetime; rocSHMEM must already be
initialised:

    dist.init_process_group(backend="gloo")
    rocshmem4py.init_rocshmem_by_uniqueid(dist.group.WORLD)
    provider = RocshmemProvider()
